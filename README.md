Within a banking application, this codeÂ offers a framework for managing users, transactions, and financial accounts. Fundamentally, it consists of a base class called Account that has common properties and methods shared by several account kinds, including name, account number, balance, and charges. In addition, the Account class specifies how to deposit and withdraw money as well as how to print account information. Specialized account types, such as Savings Account and Checking Account, are implemented and derived from Account. SavingsAccount changes the withdrawal mechanism to verify that there are no charges before allowing a withdrawal, while CheckingAccount adds a feature to log the days between paychecks. The code also presents a Transaction class for managing financial transactions, which includes the transaction's date, payments, and credits. Credit card statements are specialized to display information like the statement date, credits due, and the amount before and after payment. The CcStatement class inherits from both Transaction and Account. To handle specific users of the banking application, a User class is offered. It contains properties for an array of accounts, the user's name, and the student number. The class allows users to have accounts added to them and prints all of the account information related to that user. This codebase's architecture, taken as a whole, adheres to object-oriented concepts to produce a modular and expandable system for handling different kinds of financial accounts and transactions.
